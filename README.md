# Javascript-Quiz
Creating a JavaScript Quiz

This project was part of 'making a quiz from scratch'. Goal is to create a quiz, using javascript. Since this was a project from 'scratch', all the necessary files had to be created.
Therefore, my index.html, script.js, and style.css were created. We were given an 'acceptance criteria' to fullfill for this project. Below is my guidelines for the 'acceptance criteria'.


CHALLENGES

This, so far, was the hardest challenge for me. I am still not confident on using javascript on my own yet. I did resort to a lot of resources, whether it be class activites, research online, or watching videos. 
This project in particular I had to watch videos online. The videos online brokedown the process on creating a quiz. This helped me a lot, just because I somewhat knew where to start my javascript code, but didn't have confidence to do so.
I've also used the website 'Stack Overflow'. There were quite a few resources in regards to making a quiz, so it was the first time I used it and it helped. 
In my javascript code, my biggest struggles were my 'showQuestion', 'handleAnswer', and 'saveScore' functions. I had the hardest time because I didn't know what to do.
These functions in particular I had to resort to all my resources. Online videos or tutorials helped. This project did help me understand way more about javascript. My current struggle with javascript, is that you can do multiple things and still have the same output. It is good to have multiple things, but for me it is somewhat overwhelming.
I will need to practice a lot more.
